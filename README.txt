Welcome to my first Data Communication Project 1
Checkpoint 1: 
Status:
Task —> to download file from the given url (including with chunk encoding)
This checkpoint Completed leaving with the cleaning of the code

To Use:
use the command in the following format to use:
./srget -o <desired file name> <desired url>

Your url should follow the following format:
http://<domain> <optional —> “:port”> <path>
if you don’t specify path, don’t worry we correct it for you 
Although if you don’t put http the program will complain.


I have not comment on the parts that are used for chunk encoding,
